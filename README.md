# weather-app

### Purpose
A simple weather app to experiment with making API calls.

### Demo

Try out the live demo [here](https://justinleski.github.io/weather-app/).

### Challenges Faced
- Deploying this app to GitHub Pages posed a challenge as I had to refactor the code to use the imported images instead of the filepath
    - Using the direct filepath does not work with a bundler
